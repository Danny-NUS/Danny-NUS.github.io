## About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a>, <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore (NUS)</a>, where I am privileged to be advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/wangye/">Ye Wang (王晔)</a> in the <a href="https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/">Sound and Music Computing (SMC) Lab</a>. I earned my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from NUS in 2023, completing my master's thesis on singing voice synthesis under the guidance of Prof. Ye Wang. In 2022, I received my B.Sc. degree in <a href="https://is.bupt.edu.cn/">Telecommunications Engineering with Management</a> from <a href="http://www.bupt.edu.cn/">Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)</a> and <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</a> with first Class Degree, where I completed my bachelor's thesis on symbolic music generation under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://shengchenli.github.io/">Shengchen Li (李圣辰)</a>.

Moreover, I have a strong musical background in piano 🎹 and singing 🎤. In 2022, I was thrilled to join the <a href="https://cfa.nus.edu.sg/explore/talent/arts-groups/music/nus-jazz-band/">NUS Jazzband</a> as a vocalist 🎷. You can catch some of our performances on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nusjazzband">YouTube</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I had the honor of serving as the conductor of the AiYue Choir 🎼 at BUPT and performing as a bass singer with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNMAnNY_93rND1mh8qRP7fQ">Beijing Queer Chorus (BQC)</a> 🌈. 
Music has always been the heartbeat of my life and research. My deep passion for music fuels my creativity and drives me to push the boundaries in the thrilling world of AI 🤖 and music 🎵. Each note and melody inspires me to innovate and excel, blending technology and artistry in harmony. 🚀✨
